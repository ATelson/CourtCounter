# CourtCounter
this is a Keep score app made by Android Studios

During phase two of my Innovation Project, Ive learned many new ways to make my app interactive.
I learned how to create buttons and how to make them dynamic. I learned how Java ties into creating Android apps
and to be honest, I didnt ecpect it to make sense so quickly. I soon began to put pieces together from what I've been learning
about java into my Program. This was a great idea.
